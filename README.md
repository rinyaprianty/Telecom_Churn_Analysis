# Telecom_Churn_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company to identify at-risk customers, understand churn drivers, and quantify the economic impact of customer attrition. The analysis combines exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and financial modeling to create actionable business insights.
## Dataset
The analysis uses the Iranian Churn Dataset, which contains customer data from a telecom provider, including:
- Customer demographics
- Contract information
- Call behavior metrics
- Charge amounts
- Churn status (target variable)

## Key Objectives:
- Identify factors that significantly influence customer churn
- Segment customers based on behavior and churn risk
- Develop predictive models to identify customers likely to churn
- Quantify financial impact of churn and potential ROI of retention efforts

## Technical Approach
The analysis follows a structured methodology:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution analysis of numerical features
- Correlation analysis with significance testing
- Temporal patterns in customer behavior
2. Feature Engineering & Customer Segmentation
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- K-means clustering for customer segmentation
- Time-based cohort analysis
3. Predictive Modeling
- Multiple model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Feature importance analysis
- Customer risk scoring framework
4. Economic Impact Analysis
- Quantification of revenue loss due to churn
- ROI calculation for retention initiatives
- Scenario modeling for various intervention strategies
